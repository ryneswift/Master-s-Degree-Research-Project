This folder contains an R code file as well as the summary of my master's degree research project.

The R code produced the output seen in the presentation and the report.

The Research Project Report file is the formal report made on my research project, and details the steps performed from the beginning to the end of it. It also goes into full detail on the results of the output, and the methodologies performed.

The presentation file is a shortened summary of the details in the Research Project Report file. Reading it is recommended if a quick summary of my project is desired.
